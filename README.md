## Brief Overview

The Adopt Fund API is a node-express app connecting to a database through knex.  It is the basis for the Adopt Fund Website that utilizes the server built in this project.  The PostgreSQL database consists of four main tables: Users, Family, Donation, and Comments.  All endpoints are tested using Mocha Chai.
